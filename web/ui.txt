Product Requirements Document

Product name: Short-Form Adaptive Learning Feed
Inspiration: Uplearn + Instagram Reels
Primary user: University student learning from uploaded course material

1. Product Goal

Create a vertically scrollable, short-form learning interface where each “reel” teaches one concept using the most effective interaction type for that subject. Progress is earned through interaction, not passive viewing.

2. Core UX Principles

Vertical, swipe-based navigation only.

One concept per screen.

Interaction is mandatory to advance progress.

UI adapts to subject and concept type.

Minimal chrome. Full-screen focus.

3. Primary Screens
3.1 Upload & Processing Screen

Purpose: Allow user to upload course material and see processing status.

UI Requirements

File upload area (PDF, PPT, DOC).

Course name input.

Processing state indicator:

Extracting topics

Generating reels

Ready

Success State

CTA: “Start Learning”

Shows number of topics generated.

3.2 Course Feed Screen (Main Experience)

Purpose: Primary learning interface.

Layout

Full-screen vertical feed.

One reel visible at a time.

Swipe up/down to navigate.

No horizontal gestures.

Persistent Elements

Top: course name + topic progress bar.

Bottom right: subtle progress indicator.

No visible menus during learning.

4. Reel Types (UI Variants)

The UI generator must support multiple reel templates. Each reel declares its ui_type and renders accordingly.

4.1 Stepwise Transformation Reel (Math / Linear Algebra)

Use case: Matrix reduction, derivations, proofs.

Components

Central content: matrix or equation block.

Animated arrow indicating transformation.

Step label (e.g. R2 → R2 − 2R1).

“Why?” toggle reveals explanation.

Interaction

Tap “Next Step” to proceed.

Progress advances per confirmed step.

4.2 Definition Match Reel (Medicine / Biology / Law)

Use case: Terminology memorization.

Components

Left: draggable terms.

Right: definition cards.

Visual feedback on correct match.

Interaction

Drag term onto definition.

Reel completes only after all matches correct.

4.3 Visual Labeling Reel

Use case: Anatomy, diagrams, graphs.

Components

Central image.

Label targets highlighted on tap.

Labels appear when correctly placed.

Interaction

Tap or drag labels onto image.

Partial progress allowed.

4.4 Concept Explanation + Check

Use case: Theory-heavy content.

Components

Short explanation text (max 3 bullets).

Single conceptual question.

2–4 answer choices.

Interaction

Select answer.

Immediate feedback.

Explanation on incorrect attempt.

5. Progress & Feedback
5.1 Topic Progress Bar

One progress bar per major topic.

Fills based on completed sub-concepts.

Visible at top of feed.

5.2 Reel Completion Rules

Viewing alone does not count.

Interaction completion required.

Failed attempts do not advance progress.

6. Navigation Rules

Swipe up/down only.

No skipping locked reels.

Can revisit completed reels.

Resume exactly where user stopped.

7. Visual Style Guidelines

Clean, high-contrast.

Subject-specific accent colors:

Math: blue/teal.

Medicine: green.

Law: dark neutral.

Animations are subtle and instructional.

Avoid gamified clutter.

8. Accessibility

Large tap targets.

Clear contrast ratios.

Animations must not obscure content.

Optional text-only fallback per reel.

9. Non-Goals

No chat interface.

No long-form reading views.

No social features.

No manual note editing.

10. Output Expectations for UI Generator

The UI generator should:

Produce reusable reel templates.

Support dynamic rendering based on ui_type.

Maintain consistent vertical feed behavior.

Allow easy addition of new reel types.

11. One-Line Product Definition

A short-form, adaptive learning feed where progress is earned through interaction, not scrolling.
